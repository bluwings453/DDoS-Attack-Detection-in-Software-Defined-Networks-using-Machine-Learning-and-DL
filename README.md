# DDoS Attack Detection in Software-Defined Networks using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Technologies 🚀

## 📄 Project Overview  
This project aims to detect Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) technologies. DDoS attacks pose a significant threat to network security, and traditional detection methods often fall short in dynamic SDN environments. This project explores the potential of advanced ML/DL models for accurate and timely DDoS detection.
